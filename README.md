# React + TypeScript + Vite

After cloning or forking the app locally, to run the app you need to run these 2 commands

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

- I have used Vite to create the app, along withÂ TypeScript.
- Also used Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) for state management and API calls.
- Have created loader and No results found section too.
- Added filters and sorting too. And used a custom hook for managing the pagination.
- Added some minor hover effects on the component possible.
- Also completed 2nd Bonus point of showing Page Not Found on any other routes.
