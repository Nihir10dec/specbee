# React + TypeScript + Vite

After cloning or forking the app locally, to run the app you need to run these 2 commands

```
npm i
npm run dev
```

- Utilized Vite with TypeScript for app creation
- Implemented Redux Toolkit Query (RTK Query) for state management and API calls
- Developed "Loader" and "No results found" sections.
- Filters and sorting functionalities were integrated, with pagination handled by a custom hook.
- Added minor hover effects to enhance user experience.
- The second bonus point was also completed, which includes displaying a "Page Not Found" message for undefined routes.
